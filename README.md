# COMP_551_Project_2

Here is the initial README for Project 2

Using the 'main.py' file, run it and choose if you would like to clean the text dataset [c], use the existing saved cleaned dataset [e], or use the original unfiltered dataset [u].

Then, select tuning or predicting [t/p] based on the text classification pipeline that is configured on line 81 (of 'main.py').

Hyper-parameters can be tuned and tweaked starting on line 98.

The resulting test predictions are then saved to an output file as 'predictions.csv' which is formatted to be uploaded to Kaggle.

Required dependencies are:
- pandas
- numpy
- sklearn
- nltk
- gensim
- scipy
- seaborn
- textblob
